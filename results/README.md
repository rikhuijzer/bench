# Results 

Results are stored here. The goal of these files is to be easy to process for a computer 
and human. 


Therefore the results are in YAML and CSV files. For each system and corpus a folder
is created containing the files listed below.

This files can be used by the system to report system performance. Performance statistics include:
- F1 score (micro, macro scores for intent and entity)
- Average response time
- Training time

## `general.yml`
For the general information YAML is used. 

TODO: Consider just reporting all sklearn.metrics. Nah seems bit chaotic and useless.

```yaml
system name: str

corpus: str

training time [seconds]: float

f1 scores:
  micro: float
  macro: float

response_time [ms]:
  average: int
  standard deviation: int
```

## `intents.csv`
Below is an example from a system which classified two sentences. 

| id | sentence | intent | classification | confidence [%] | time [ms] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 0 | When is tomorrows first flight to London? | departure time | greet | 20.3 | 50 |
| 1 | Will it rain on monday? | get weather | get weather | 99.1 | 40

## `entities.csv`
The system also classified entities. For reader convenience the correct entities have been added as well.

| id | sentence id | source | entity | value | start | stop | confidence [%]
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | gold standard | date | tomorrows | 8 | 17 | 
| 1 | 0 | gold standard | location | London | 36 | 43 | 
| 2 | 0 | classification | location | London | 36 | 43 | 83.3
| 3 | 1 | gold standard | weather | rain | 8 | 13 | 
| 4 | 1 | gold standard | date | monday | 18 | 25 |
| 5 | 1 | classification | weather | rain on | 8 | 16 | 62.8
| 6 | 1 | classification | date | monday | 18 | 25 |
