        When you train a named_entity_extractor you need to get a dataset of sentences (or
        sentence or paragraph length chunks of text) where each sentence is annotated with
        the entities you want to find.  For example, if we wanted to find all the names of
        people and organizations then we would need to get a bunch of sentences with
        examples of person names and organizations in them.  Here is an example:
            My name is Davis King and I work for MIT.
        "Davis King" is a person name and "MIT" is an organization.  

        You then give MITIE these example sentences with their entity annotations and it will
        learn to detect them.  That is what we do below.  
    */

    // annotation indicates that the token at index 3 and consisting of 2 tokens is a
    // person.  I.e. "Davis King" is a person name.

    // is created by the tool in the MITIE/tools/wordrep folder.  The wordrep tool analyzes
    // a large document corpus, learns important word statistics, and then outputs a
    // total_word_feature_extractor that is knowledgeable about a particular language (e.g.
    // English).  MITIE comes with a total_word_feature_extractor for English so that is
    // what we use here.  But if you need to make your own you do so using a command line 
    // statement like:
    //    wordrep -e a_folder_containing_only_text_files
    // and wordrep will create a total_word_feature_extractor.dat based on the supplied

    // if a large text dataset is given.  So use a powerful machine and be patient.
